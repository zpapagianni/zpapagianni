### Data Scientist

I am a mechanical engineer looking to transition into Data Science. I am currently studying Data Science and Machine Learning at Imperial College London.

Those repositories contain a portfolio of data science projects completed by me for academic, self learning, and hobby purposes. Presented in the form of Jupyter Notebooks, and R markdown files (published at RPubs).

I am in the process of adding some new projects using SQL and Tableau.
