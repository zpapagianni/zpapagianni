### Data Scientist

<!--
**zpapagianni/zpapagianni** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

I am a mechanical engineer looking to transition into Data Science. I am currently studying Data Science and Machine Learning at Imperial College London.

Those repositories contain a portfolio of data science projects completed by me for academic, self learning, and hobby purposes. Presented in the form of Jupyter Notebooks, and R markdown files (published at RPubs).
